
## üöÄ **Overview**
This Python-based project delves into the concepts of **probability theory** applied to the classic game of **Ludo**. The goal is to understand and simulate the various probabilistic elements of the game, such as dice rolls, player movement, and strategic decisions. The project provides an in-depth analysis of how probability can be used to optimize gameplay strategies and improve the chances of winning.

### üìö **Key Concepts**
- **Dice Probability**: Analyzing the likelihood of different dice roll outcomes.
- **Player Movement Simulation**: Understanding how player movement is affected by chance and optimizing strategies.
- **Turn-based Analysis**: Probability calculations for each player's turn and the impact of each roll on the game's progression.

## üîß **Features**
- **Probability Calculations**: Implementations of various probability calculations relevant to Ludo, including the chances of rolling specific values on a six-sided dice and outcomes for various game scenarios.
- **Strategy Analysis**: Examination of optimal strategies based on probabilistic outcomes, such as the best choices to make based on current dice rolls and board positioning.
- **Simulation**: Simulation of game scenarios to validate theoretical probabilities, providing a more practical understanding of how different strategies work in the game.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Collecting and analyzing data from multiple simulations to determine the most frequent outcomes and potential strategies.

## üìù **Installation & Setup**
To run the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/abdelkarimse/Ludo_Project_python_probabilite.git
    ```

2. **Navigate into the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd Ludo_Project_python_probabilite
    ```

3. **Install the necessary Python dependencies**:
    It's recommended to use a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```


4. **Run the project**:
    Execute the main script to start the Ludo simulation and analysis:
    ```bash
    python Ludo_Python.py
    ```

## üî¨ **How It Works**
This project uses **Monte Carlo simulations** to calculate the probabilities of different events in the game of Ludo. The simulation approach involves running multiple iterations of the game with random dice rolls and recording the outcomes to estimate the probability of various game states. Some key parts of the implementation include:

- **Dice Roll Simulation**: The program simulates multiple dice rolls and calculates the probability of each possible outcome.
- **Turn Logic**: Simulating a turn in the game where players take actions based on their dice roll and board state.
- **Game State Management**: Keeping track of the current state of the game, including player positions, active tokens, and any special game conditions.

## üßë‚Äçüíª **Usage**
Once the project is set up, you can run simulations with varying strategies and examine the results. The project will print out statistical data on game progress, including:

- **Number of turns** taken to finish the game.
- **Frequency of winning outcomes** for each player.
- **Analysis of dice roll distributions** during the game.

You can experiment with different game rules or player strategies to see how they impact the chances of winning.
